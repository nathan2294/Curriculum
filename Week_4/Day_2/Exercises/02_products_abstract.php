        /**
         * OVERVIEW:
         * So, our boss gave us a call and hated the fact that 2 pieces of clothing had such
         * different looking descriptions.  He wanted to look at 2 different pieces of clothing
         * and be able to compare them side by side without much effort.  Same with the
         * 2 pieces of electronics.  He would like to see the size and display types shown in
         * exactly the same format
         *
         * INSTRUCTIONS:
         * Tweak your Product class from Step 1.  Since a Product is so Generic that we will
         * never want to create a "Product", let's make it an abstract class.  To make sure
         * that our products of similar type are described in a similar fashion, we want to
         * restrict how our descriptions are created.  Delete the description property from
         * our Product class and remove it from the constructor.  Instead of having the
         * provideDescription method output the description property, let's have it return
         * the value provided by an abstract method named "provideDescriptionForProductType".
         *
         * Let's now create two classes that extend our Product class, one called Clothing, and
         * one called Television.
         *
         * Let's add properties "size", "color", and "gender" to the
         * Clothing class and create a constructor that takes the parameters "name", "price",
         * "brand", "size", "color", and "type", and "gender".  Use the parent class
         * constructor to set the
         * values of the first 3 properties and the child constructor to set the value of
         * the second 3.  Have the Clothing class implement the
         * "provideDescriptionForProductType" method by outputting "This is an article of
         * clothing.  It is a {brand} {color} {gender} {type} of size {size}.  It costs"
         *
         * Lets add properties "displayType" and "size" to the Television class and create a
         * constructor that takes the parameters "name", "price",
         * "brand", "displayType", and "size".  Use the parent class
         * constructor to set the values of the first 3 properties and the child constructor
         *  to set the value of the last 2  Have the Television class implement the
         * "provideDescriptionForProduct" type method to output "This is a {size} {brand}
         * {displayType} Television"
         *
         * Create The following products and echo their provideDescription methods.
